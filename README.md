# truckly
This application was created to solve a common problem: the lack of a dedicated app for food trucks that helps both customers and owners stay updated.

Many times, customers go to a food truck location only to find out that it has moved without any notice. This creates frustration and inconvenience.

That’s why I developed Truckly — an application that brings both food truck owners and customers together in one place.
Truckly helps owners manage their truck information, location, and availability, while allowing customers to easily discover food trucks, check their status, and stay informed
